# Project #7: Keyboard Drum Kit

## About

When a corresponding key is hit on the keyboard, two things will happen:

1. The drum sound associated with that key will be played
2. Short animation highlights which key was pressed

## Logic

A `.playing` class is added to a key to highlight it was pressed.

A `div` with `.keys` class stores all the playable `.key`s. Each of these `.key`s are also `div`s themselves which contains the sound it will make and which key should be hit on the keyboard.

The `keydown` event listens for when a key is pressed down. The associated `event.code` property is then used to match a corresponding drum audio with `data-key` attribute.

> ℹ️ Info
>
> `event.code` - Returns physical key location on keyboard
>
> `event.key` - Returns character identifier generated by key
>
> Example:
>
> | Key           | `event.code` |   `event.key` |
> | :------------ | :----------: | ------------: |
> | `Z`           |    `KeyZ`    | Lowercase `z` |
> | `Shift` + `Z` |    `KeyZ`    | Uppercase `Z` |
>
> In this project, `event.code` is used due to case insensitive and its value is bound to the physical key location.

`data-*` is used to make your own custom HTML attribute. `data-key` is created to store audio elements and link to the respective keys pressed.
